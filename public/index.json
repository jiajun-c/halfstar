Summary # This paper introduce the OoO commit in the cpu, which is less concerned than the OoO execution and branch prediction.\n2. position of the commit # Commit is usually is last stage of the cpu. In the commit stage the resources allocated by rob, regfile\u0026hellip; will be freed.\n3. Why commit in order? # Commit inorder can avoid many problems like waw conflict or commit the misprediction instructions.\n4. The condition for the OoO commit # 4.1 Finished the execution # Before commit the instructions, it should complete it access to all of the function units.\n4.2 WAR Hazard # A store instruction can not be commit until the load to the target register is already committed.\n4.3 on the right branch # The instruction can not be commit when it knows it is on the right branch\n4.4 there is no older instruction may raise exception # when there is no older instruction will raise exception, it can commit safely.\n4.5 Replay Traps # For a memory operation to commit early it must be known that an instruction is free from store-load and load-load replay traps.\n","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/arch/paper/commit/","section":"Arches","summary":"Deconstructing Commit # link to the paper pdf","title":"Deconstructing Commit"},{"content":"","date":"7 July 2023","permalink":"/","section":"My star","summary":"","title":"My star"},{"content":" Image Thresholding # Simple Thresholding # For the simple thresholding process, when the pixels smaller than the threshold, it will be set to the 0, otherwise it will be set to 1.\nThere are several types of simple thresholds\nThere are several parameters.\nsrc: The image source threshold: The threshold maxThreshold: The maximum threshold Type: the type of threshold ret,thresh1 = cv.threshold(img,127,255,cv.THRESH_BINARY) ","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/opencv/threshold/","section":"Opencvs","summary":"Image Thresholding # Simple Thresholding # For the simple thresholding process, when the pixels smaller than the threshold, it will be set to the 0, otherwise it will be set to 1.","title":"Image Thresholding process"},{"content":"","date":"1 July 2023","permalink":"/opencv/","section":"Opencvs","summary":"","title":"Opencvs"},{"content":" Geometric Transformations of Images # 1.
