Multiplexing takes data with header lines to generate the message.

### 2.1 UDP
UDP add a little things to the ip, like the source port and the destination port.

The message of udp looks like this.

```shell
|source port | destination port|
|len         | checksum        |
the real data
```

You can examine the message of udp by checksum but you can not recover it.

### 2.2 TCP

The get back N

In the GBN protocol, it allows the senders to send multiple packets.

```shell
|the packets have been ack|base| the packets have been send but not ack |nextseqnum| wait to send |
```

When the windows is full, it will not send any packets. What's more, the GBN use the 
cumulative acknowledge to store the ack.

When the timeout, the gbn will send all the packets it send but not ack.
